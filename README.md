### Distributed E-Commerce Platform

#### **Project Overview**

The Distributed E-Commerce Platform is designed to provide a seamless e-commerce experience with scalability, reliability, and flexibility. It adopts a microservices architecture to handle high traffic and diverse functionalities. The platform's core features include:

- **User Management:** Registration, login, authentication, and role-based access control.
- **Product Browsing and Search:** Display, category browsing, and product search.
- **Order Management:** Placing orders, viewing statuses, and admin order management.
- **Payment Processing:** Integration with third-party payment services like PayPal or Stripe.
- **Notification System:** Real-time order status updates and promotional notifications.
- **Recommendation System:** Personalized recommendations based on user behavior.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Manage users, orders, and products for merchants and admins.

#### **Technology Stack**

##### **Frontend**
- **React.js:** Responsive and dynamic UI development.
- **Redux:** State management.
- **Axios:** API integration.
- **Material-UI:** Modern UI components.

##### **Backend**
- **Spring Boot:** Microservices development and request handling.

#### **System Architecture**

##### **1. Microservices**
The platform consists of the following microservices:

- **User Service:** User registration, login, and management.
- **Product Service:** Product information and categories management.
- **Order Service:** Order creation and status updates.
- **Payment Service:** Payment integration with third-party APIs.
- **Notification Service:** Sends updates on order statuses.
- **Recommendation Service:** Generates recommendations.

##### **2. API Gateway**
- **Nginx** or **Spring Cloud Gateway** for frontend-backend communication.

##### **3. Message Queue**
- **Kafka** for inter-service asynchronous communication (e.g., inventory updates post-order).

##### **4. Data Storage**
- **MySQL:** Core business data.
- **Redis:** Caching for performance.

#### **Development Process**

##### **1. Requirements Analysis**
- Functional:
  - User management.
  - Product browsing and order management.
  - Notifications and recommendations.
- Non-functional:
  - High scalability.
  - Secure communication via JWT.
  - High availability via load balancing.

##### **2. Architectural Design**
- Create system architecture and database schema diagrams.
- Define communication protocols (REST API and Kafka).

##### **3. Backend Development**

###### **User Service**
- **Tech Stack:** Spring Boot, MySQL, Spring Security, JWT.
- **Features:** User registration, login, and role-based access.

###### **Product Service**
- **Tech Stack:** Spring Boot, MySQL.
- **Features:** Product CRUD, categorization, and search.

###### **Order Service**
- **Tech Stack:** Spring Boot, Kafka, MySQL.
- **Features:** Order creation and status management.

###### **Payment Service**
- **Tech Stack:** Spring Boot, third-party API integration.
- **Features:** Payment initiation and confirmation.

###### **Notification Service**
- **Tech Stack:** Spring Boot, Kafka.
- **Features:** Order status updates and promotional notifications.

---

##### **4. Frontend Development**
- **Framework:** React.js.
- **Features:** UI for product display, user profile, and order management.
- **Tools:** Axios for API communication, Material-UI for styling.

##### **5. Testing and Optimization**
###### **Testing**
- Tools: **Postman** (API), **JUnit** (Unit Testing), **Selenium** (UI Testing).
- Types: Unit, integration, and performance tests.

###### **Optimization**
- Add database indices.
- Cache frequent queries using Redis.
- Use Nginx and Kubernetes for load balancing.
